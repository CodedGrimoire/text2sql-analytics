## 2. Query Performance Metrics

- **Execution Time Distribution**
  - Median query execution: ~0.45s
  - Fastest: 0.12s (simple SELECT queries with LIMIT)
  - Slowest: 1.02s (multi-join queries with aggregation)
  - Timeout Threshold: 2 seconds (enforced via `execute_query`)
  - Most queries executed well under threshold.

- **Heuristic Accuracy Scores**
  - Average score: **0.72**
  - Best performing class: **Complex Queries** (avg score: 0.85)
  - Lowest performing: **Simple Queries** (avg score: 0.55, impacted by API quota errors).

## 3. Failed Queries Analysis

### Quota Errors (Gemini API)
- **Root Cause:** Exceeded free-tier request limits.
- **Impact:** Tests like `customers_from_germany`, `most_expensive_product`, and `aggregate_query_generation` could not run successfully due to API 429 errors.
- **Solution:** Upgrade API quota, implement request throttling, or fallback to cached SQL.

### Schema Misalignment
- **Failure:** `test_foreign_key_detection`
- **Cause:** Northwind Excel schema loaded into DataLoader lacked explicit PK/FK metadata; naive detection could not find relationships.
- **Solution:** Enhance FK inference using heuristics (e.g., matching `customer_id` across tables).

### Dynamic Pipeline Failures
- **Failure:** `test_export_schema_and_indexes`
- **Cause:** Missing PKs in `mainsheet` → `KeyError`.
- **Solution:** Add default PK inference or auto-generate surrogate keys.

### Accuracy Threshold Failure
- **Failure:** `monthly_sales_trends_1997`
- **Cause:** Generated SQL included schema-specific column names (`sellprice`, `quantity`) that mismatched.
- **Solution:** Improve prompt engineering to align column naming conventions.

---

## 4. Database Optimization Opportunities

- **Indexes:** Add composite indexes on frequently joined columns (`orders.customer_id`, `products.category_id`).
- **Connection Pooling:** Already configured via `QueuePool` with 5 connections (expandable).
- **Query Plans:** Integration with `EXPLAIN` can further optimize cost-heavy queries.
- **Caching:** Current in-memory query cache reduces repeated query latency by ~25%.

---

## 5. Lessons Learned & Challenges Faced

- LLMs can generate syntactically correct SQL but often mismatch schema column names.
- API rate limits significantly impact automated test reliability.
- Dynamic schema inference from Excel requires robust fallback strategies.
- Balancing strict SQL sanitization with flexibility is crucial for usability.

---

## 6. Time Spent on Each Component

- **Core Engine (`text2sql_engine`)**: 12 hours (LLM integration, validation, caching).
- **Data Loader & Normalization**: 10 hours (Excel/CSV ingestion, dtype validation, null handling).
- **Query Validator**: 5 hours (sanitization, regex rules, limit enforcement).
- **Database Utilities**: 4 hours (engine pooling, reset, transaction handling).
- **Testing & Debugging**: 15+ hours (pytest, fixing schema alignment, coverage).
- **Documentation (README, Evaluation)**: 4 hours.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The project achieved a **~80% pass rate** despite API quota limitations and schema detection gaps.  
Future improvements include:
- Increasing Gemini API quota / implementing caching strategies.
- More robust schema inference (PK/FK detection).
- Expanding test coverage to normalization pipeline.
- Optimizing database queries with index tuning and query plan monitoring.
